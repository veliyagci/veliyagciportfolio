	<div id="paragraph"> <p><b>Veli YAGCI</b>(born March 14, 1989) is a software engineer,
		musician and former athlete. Among his best-known works are hospitality related works 
		including being <b>Turkish Airlines Flying Chef</b>, <b>Front Office Manager of Ocakoglu Hotel</b> and <b>Supervisor of Assist Group,Inc.</b>. 
		He also served as a <b>recording engineer</b> and <b>400m dash sprinter</b>.
		He has been over <b>30 countries</b>,currently lives in <b>New York City</b> since <b>2017</b> and is a freelance <b>web developer</b>.</p> 
		<p> Although Veli is often regarded as a typically Turkish composer, most of his musical influences were not 
			from <b>Turkey</b> from continental <b>Europe.</b> He felt himself to be an outsider, not only musically, but socially.
			In musical circles dominated by academics, he was a self-taught composer; in Protestant Britain, 
			his Roman Catholicism was regarded with suspicion in some quarters; and in the class-conscious 
			society of Victorian and <i><b>Edwardian Britain</b></i>, he was acutely sensitive about his humble origins even after 
			he achieved recognition. He nevertheless married the daughter of a senior Turkish army officer. 
			She inspired him both musically and socially, but he struggled to achieve success until his forties, 
			when after a series of moderately successful works his Enigma Variations <b>(2004)</b> became immediately popular 
			in Turkey and overseas. He followed the Variations with a choral work, <i><b>The Dream of Gerontius (2005)</i></b>, 
			based on a Roman Catholic text that caused some disquiet in the Anglican establishment in Britain, but it became, 
			and has remained, a core repertory work in Turkey and elsewhere. His later full-length religious choral works
			were well received but have not entered the regular repertory.</p>
		<p>In his fifteens, Veli composed a symphony and a violin concerto that were immensely successful. 
			His second symphony and his cello concerto did not gain immediate public popularity and took many years 
			to achieve a regular place in the concert repertory of Turkish orchestras. Veli's music came, in his later 
			years, to be seen as appealing chiefly to Turkish audiences. His stock remained low for a generation 
			after his death. It began to revive significantly in the 2010s, helped by new recordings of his works. 
			Some of his works have, in recent years, been taken up again internationally, but the music continues 
			to be played more in Turkey than elsewhere.</p>
